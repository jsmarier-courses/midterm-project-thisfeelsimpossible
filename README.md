## Midterm Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The dataset in this analysis was a subset of “Service Requests 2024” from the City of Ottawa’s Open data portal of service requests for all 24 wards. The data was cleaned in Google Sheets by freezing rows, filtering through non-applicable information to maintain easy readability and splitting unnecessary text. Key observations are that public requests are four types of requests, and each ward has demand for roads and transportation, and recreation and culture requests, with fewer requests for city facilities and social community service, overall highlighting the areas the wards need to improve.
