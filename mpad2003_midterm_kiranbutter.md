# Midterm Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Use one hashtag symbol (`#`) to create a level 1 heading like this one. - yo did I fix the issue?

## Foreword

For this assignment, you must extract data from a dataset provided by the instructor. You must then clean and analyze the data, create exploratory charts/visualizations, and find a potential story idea. Your assignment must clearly detail your process. You are expected to write about 1500-2000 words, and to include several screen captures showing the different steps you went through. Your assignment must be written with the Markdown format and submitted on GitHub Classroom.

I have been assigning different versions of this project to my digital journalism and data storytelling students for a few years now. Its structure was inspired by the main sections/chapters of [*The Data Journalism Handbook*](https://datajournalism.com/read/handbook/one/). This version was further inspired by the [Key Capabilities in Data Science](https://extendedlearning.ubc.ca/programs/key-capabilities-data-science) program offered by the University of British Columbia (UBC).

**Here are some useful resources for this assignment:**

* [GitHub's *Basic writing and formatting syntax* page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
* [The template repository for this assignment in case you delete something by mistake](https://github.com/jsmarier/jou4100_jou4500_mpad2003_project2_template)

Did you notice how to create a hyperlink? In Markdown, we put the clickable text between square brackets and the actual URL between parentheses.

And to create an unordered list, we simply put a star (`*`) before each item.

## 1. Introduction

## 2. Getting Data

Use two hashtag symbols (`##`) to create a level 2 heading like this one.

To include a screen capture, use the sample code below. Your images should be saved in the same folder as your `.md` file.

*Figure 1: The "Import file" prompt on Google Sheets.*

To import the data into google sheets, I clicked save link as and saved the CSV file on my computer; it will save as a text file.
I then went to Google Sheets, clicked the File option in the top menu, clicked on import, then uploaded the data set text file. 
Then, I selected the comma option for the separator type, and clicked the import data. Once that has been clicked, the message ‘Success! File imported. Open now >>” will appear, and then click the Open now blue hyperlink and it will bring you to the imported dataset. 


This is the dataset right after it has been imported. 


Since it is a dataset from the City of Ottawa, for any description, it is written in both English and French, making the cell's length dragged out when clicked on. Looking at the dataset, there are 11 columns, letters A to K, and 28539 rows of data. In terms of how the data is structured, every data is within their respective cells–there is no overlapping into other cells. The majority of the address, latitude, longitude and ward columns will have \N in their cells, leaving gaps in the dataset. 


Columns A to D, G and K contain nominal variables since they consist of categories and differ from one another in names with no natural order (such as the status, type, description, etc.) (insert cites), whereas, columns E, F, H, I and J consist of numeric variables since they are numbers, and are either continuous within a given interval (such as the longitude or latitude) or discrete by only being specific values (like the wards) (insert cites).  

One question that comes to mind when I examine the raw data is “What is the most common type of request that gets asked?” since there are a handful of types listed in the column which determine the specific action for the city to partake. 


**Here are examples of functions and lines of code put in grey boxes:**

1. If you name a function, put it between "angled" quotation marks like this: `IMPORTHTML`.
1. If you want to include the entire line of code, do the same thing, albeit with your entire code: `=IMPORTHTML("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"; "table", 5)`.
1. Alternatively, you can put your code in an independent box using the template below:

``` r
=IMPORTHTML("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"; "table", 5)
```
This also shows how to create an ordered list. Simply put `1.` before each item.

## 3. Understanding Data

### 3.1. VIMO Analysis

Use three hashtag symbols (`###`) to create a level 3 heading like this one. Please follow this template when it comes to level 1 and level 2 headings. However, you can use level 3 headings as you see fit.
